# Next-Word-Predictor1. 
Introduction 
This project is based on neural network and natural language processing. We choose this project 
because dealing text data which is unstructured data is quite challenging and exciting task and more 
knowledgeable. As it covers very important concepts of artificial intelligence i.e., neural network and 
NLP.
2. Dataset 
We have predefined dataset of “The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes”. The reason behind for going with
this text data as it is quite bigger in terms of word length wise. Its corpus length is 581889 which makes 
our project best in terms of predictions also because most of words will cover in this text and during 
prediction it match the best words and recommend it from the text. So, below is dataset which is 
unstructured form.
